# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This project aims to predict the likelihood of customer churn using machine learning models. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to maintain sustainability and growth. The project is organized with the following folder structure:

## Background

In the dynamic business landscape, retaining customers is paramount for sustained success. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue using a product or service, poses a significant challenge for many companies. Addressing this challenge, the Customer Churn Prediction project is designed to assist businesses in identifying potential churners. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to create a predictive model capable of estimating the likelihood of churn for each customer based on historical data.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and well-documented model development in the Jupyter notebook (`customer_churn.ipynb`), the project provides insights into the factors that may contribute to customer decisions to discontinue subscriptions or services.

Additionally, the deployment folder (`deployment`) contains files essential for the application's deployment, including `app.py` for interactive churn prediction, `eda.py` for exploratory data analysis, `model.pkl` for the pre-trained machine learning model, `prediction.py` for prediction functionality, and `requirements.txt` listing necessary dependencies.

## How to Use

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** If you want to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, run `eda.py`. This script provides valuable exploratory data analysis.

2. **Model Development:** To view the step-by-step model development process, open and run the Jupyter notebook `customer_churn.ipynb`.

3. **Application Deployment:** To use the web application for churn prediction, run `app.py`. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r deployment/requirements.txt`.
